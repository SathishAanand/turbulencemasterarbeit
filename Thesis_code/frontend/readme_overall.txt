timesteps, epochs, batch size, learning rate, and activation function. It also sums up the individual RMSE errors and provide the final RMSE error value for all the inputs samples. All these information are saved in .csv format from wher the 
parallelplot.html file reads and renders the parallel coordinates plot.
